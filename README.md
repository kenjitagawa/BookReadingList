# Book Reading List


This is a book reading list that was originally done by Traversy Media, so, all credits to him.
I followed his tutorial to brush up on my JavaScrip skills and remember the main idea of DOM. 

With the done project, I will be using it to keep track of the books that I will be reading this year, as well as those that I will be using at school.
